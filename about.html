                   <h1>About Nay Six Nanmoo</h1>

                   <h1>Education Milestone</h1>
                   <p> He has experienced several defining challenges, having migrated from Myanmar, an 
underdeveloped nation, to the USA as a refugee. These challenges are primarily language and 
technology barriers. He didn’t give up and tried his best. Because of the language barrier, he first 
enrolled in an ESL program and then enrolled at Garden City Community College before going to 
Fort Hays State University. In December 2015, he graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Sociology. 
he overcame the language and technology barriers to earn his degree and fulfill his academic and 
career goals. His bachelor's degree has exposed him to numerous opportunities to help his 
community, especially migrants from Myanmar who face challenges and struggle to adapt to the 
new environment. As a social worker, he assisted the Myanmar refugees in searching for jobs, 
housing, and medical services.</p>

and he would like to pay it back. </p>
